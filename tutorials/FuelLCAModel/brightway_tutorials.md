# â›½ Fuel Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Model Tutorial

The Government of Canadaâ€™s Fuel Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Model is a tool that allows users to calculate the life cycle carbon intensity (CI) of fuels and energy sources produced and used in Canada. This tutorial is designed to guide students through the basics of conducting a Fuel Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in openLCA, using bioethanol as a case study.

## ðŸ“º Step 1: Introductory Videos on openLCA  

Before starting the case study, watch the following videos to become familiar with how the **Government of Canadaâ€™s Fuel LCA Model** is implemented in **openLCA**:  

- [**Part 1: Walkthrough of the Model in openLCA**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pamF7GONNXk)
  This video provides an overview of the Fuel LCA Model and demonstrates its structure and workflow in the openLCA software.   

- [**Part 2: Demonstration of a Carbon Intensity Calculation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnod3YNYrro) 
  This video walks through the process of calculating the carbon intensity (CI) of fuels using the Fuel LCA Model in openLCA.

## ðŸ§ª Step 2: Case Study â€“ Conventional Bioethanol Example

In this step, students will apply what they learned to conduct a Fuel LCA case study.

1. **Dataset**  
   - Use the provided **bioethanol production example** (available from Google Drive).  
   - Import the dataset into openLCA.  

2. **Goal and Scope**  
   - Define the system boundary: *cradle-to-gate bioethanol production*.  
   - Set the **functional unit**: 1 MJ or 1 liter of bioethanol.  

3. **Model Setup**  
   - Identify inputs (e.g., corn, transport, electricity, water).  
   - Identify outputs (e.g., bioethanol, emissions).  
   - Review allocation choices (if co-products exist).  

4. **Impact Assessment**  
   - Run the LCA model.  
   - Focus on **Global Warming Potential (GWP)** or **Carbon Intensity** results.  

5. **Interpretation**  
   - Compare the results with conventional fossil fuel pathways.  
   - Discuss potential environmental benefits and trade-offs of bioethanol.

By the end of this tutorial, students will:  
- Navigate and build models in **openLCA**.  
- Conduct a **fuel life cycle assessment** using example case data. 
- Develop skills in interpreting and reporting LCA results.
