# 🌾 GREET CCLUB Tutorial

The **Carbon Calculator for Land Use and Land Management Change from Biofuels Production (CCLUB)** is an integral component of Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies) model. It is specifically designed to evaluate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from both **land use change (LUC)** and **land management change (LMC)** within the broader framework of biofuel life cycle assessment (LCA).

## 📝 Case Study:
This case study explores the GHG emissions arising from LUC across different **bioethanol production pathway**, focusing on ethanol derived from **four biomass feedstocks: corn, corn stover, switchgrass, and Miscanthus**.


### Background Reading
1. Before starting the tutorial, let's review the concepts of LUC and their impacts by reading the *'Introduction'* section of [**Understanding options for ILUC mitigation**](https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ILUC-Mitigation-Options_ICCT_nov2016_0.pdf). To summarize, **direct land use change (dLUC)** refers to the situations where the conversion of land use pattern occurs as a result of the demand for feedstock production for biofuel and bioproducts.**Indirect land use change (iLUC)** refers to the scenarios where the land use pattern changes (e.g., grassland converted to crop land) globally to compensate for the commodity supply which is not fulfilled due to the feedstock production for biofuel and bioproducts locally.

2. Next, read the *'Introduction'* section of the [**CCLUB User Manual**](https://greet.anl.gov/publication-cclub-manual-r6-2020). This section provides background on the purpose of the CCLUB model and explain how CCLUB uses **Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)** outputs with emission factors (EF) to estimate GHG emissions of LUC.

### Step 1: Set Up & Files

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- `CCLUB_2024_Rev1.xlsm` saved in your GREET download folder (e.g., **R&D GREET_2024 Rev1**).


Open the Excel workbook. Here is an overview of the CCLUB worksheets:

| International Reversion    | Source data for international land reversions. |
| Saved Results              | LUC and LMC results to be used in GREET. |


- Locate the **LUC Scenario & Results** sheet — this is where we will calculate the GHG emissions associated with LUC for bioethanol production pathways.

## Step 2: Choose & Configure Your Scenario (LUC)

Follow the inputs **top → bottom** on the **LUC Scenario & Results** sheet, then review the results at the end. Users select input values in the **rose-colored** cells. All options are visible in the **yellow** cells in each section.

### 2.1 Select Feedstock to Fuel Pathway — *Input 1*
The first user input (Input 1) is the feedstock-to-fuel pathway. The user can choose from among the biofuel production scenarios, which include options for corn and cellulosic ethanol feedstock (corn stover, switchgrass, or Miscanthus), and soy biodiesel. Each scenario reflects a shock to the economy in response to an increase in demand for a particular biofuel modeling by **GTAP**. In this case study, we will focus on the following ethanol production scenarios:
| # | Ethanol Pathway       | GTAP Case Description                                                                 |
|---|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Corn Ethanol 2011      | Increase in corn ethanol production from its 2004 level (3.41 BG) to 15 BG      |
| 2 | Stover Ethanol         | Increase of ethanol from corn stover by 9 BG, on top of 15 BG corn ethanol (continuous corn) |
| 3 | Switchgrass Ethanol    | Increase of ethanol from switchgrass by 7 BG, on top of 15 BG corn ethanol      |
| 4 | Miscanthus Ethanol     | Increase of ethanol from miscanthus by 7 BG, on top of 15 BG corn ethanol       |

**Note**: For more details on GTAP modeling, see *Section 2* of the **CCLUB User Manual**.

### 2.2 Select an SOC & N₂O Modeling Scenario — *Input 2*
Input 2 allows the user to specify how soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions are modeled for both domestic and international LUC. These options determine which datasets and emission factors are applied in the calculations.

Here’s what each option means:
| Option | Name             | Domestic SOC & N₂O Source | International SOC & N₂O Source | Characteristics (from CCLUB Manual) |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | DayCent & Winrock          | **DayCent** (process-based SOC at daily timestep) + **COLE** for forest aboveground carbon | **Winrock dataset** (state-/country-level EFs for LUC; includes CH₄ & N₂O from biomass burning; no harvested wood product storage) | Provides detailed, process-based domestic SOC; Winrock adds empirical global EFs with foregone sequestration included:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. |
| 2      | DayCent & AEZ-EF           | **DayCent** + **COLE**    | **AEZ-EF** (Agro-Ecological Zone emission factors) | Hybrid approach combining U.S. process-based SOC modeling with AEZ-level international carbon/N₂O factors:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. |
| 3      | AEZ-EF                     | **AEZ-EF** (applied domestically with COLE for forest) | **AEZ-EF** | Simplified and consistent option; uses spatially explicit AEZ-level emission factors for both domestic and international LUC; recommended for straightforward analysis:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. |
| 4      | Century & Winrock          | **CENTURY** (parameterized SOC model, inverse modeling) + **COLE** | **Winrock dataset** | Uses CENTURY-based SOC estimates at county/AEZ level; combined with Winrock’s empirical international dataset:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. |
| 5      | Other methods (Sec. 3–5)   | Alternatives: CENTURY/COLE, Woods Hole | Alternatives: Winrock or Woods Hole, IPCC factors | Allows use of alternative datasets (e.g., Woods Hole biome-level EFs, IPCC defaults) for advanced or comparative analysis:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. |


### 2.3 Set International Dataset — *Input 3*
- **3a — International dataset**: choose **Winrock** (country/state-level) or **Woods Hole/AEZ-EF** (biome/AEZ-level) for **non-U.S.** carbon, CH₄, and N₂O emission factors (EFs).
- **3b — Palm expansion on peat (Winrock only)**: percent of palm expansion on peat in SE Asia (commonly **0%** or **22%**).

> **Tip (Canada-focused analysis):** Canada is **international** in CCLUB. Select **Winrock** to use **country-level** EFs for Canada.

### 2.4 Configure Forest Products Assumption (U.S.) — *Input 4*
Choose **HWP (Harvested Wood Products)** handling for U.S. forests when converted:
- **Heath et al. (1996)** assumptions, or
- **All aboveground C emitted** (no product credit).

### 2.5 Biomass Burning in International Clearing — *Input 5*
- With **Winrock**: “Yes” applies burning only in countries where it is common (per Winrock); “No” disables it.
- With **CENTURY/Woods Hole**: “Yes” applies burning in all international countries; “No” disables it.

### 2.6 U.S. Forest Adjustment (Proration) — *Input 6*
Toggle **Yes** to apply CCLUB’s adjustment that splits GTAP “forest” conversions into **mature forest** vs **young-forest/shrub** (to better match U.S. inventories); **No** keeps raw GTAP.

### 2.7 Spatial Averaging Method — *Input 7*
Choose how EFs are aggregated spatially (e.g., **area-weighted**). Applies to both domestic and international EF aggregation.

### 2.8 Foregone Sequestration Period — *Input 8*
Use **30 years** to align with underlying EF time horizons (consistent with CENTURY/Winrock modeling). Large deviations can lead to inconsistent results.

### 2.9 Amortization Period — *Input 9*
Set the policy analysis horizon (e.g., **30 years**) over which total LUC emissions are annualized.
