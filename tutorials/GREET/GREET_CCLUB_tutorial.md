# üåæ GREET CCLUB Tutorial

The **Carbon Calculator for Land Use and Land Management Change from Biofuels Production (CCLUB)** is an integral component of Argonne National Laboratory‚Äôs GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies) model. It is specifically designed to evaluate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from both **land use change (LUC)** and **land management change (LMC)** within the broader framework of biofuel life cycle assessment (LCA).

## üìù Case Study:
This case study explores the GHG emissions arising from LUC across different **bioethanol production pathway**, focusing on ethanol derived from **four biomass feedstocks: corn, corn stover, switchgrass, and Miscanthus**.


### Background Reading
1. Before starting the tutorial, let's review the concepts of LUC and their impacts by reading the *'Introduction'* section of [**Understanding options for ILUC mitigation**](https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ILUC-Mitigation-Options_ICCT_nov2016_0.pdf). To summarize, **direct land use change (dLUC)** refers to the situations where the conversion of land use pattern occurs as a result of the demand for feedstock production for biofuel and bioproducts.**Indirect land use change (iLUC)** refers to the scenarios where the land use pattern changes (e.g., grassland converted to crop land) globally to compensate for the commodity supply which is not fulfilled due to the feedstock production for biofuel and bioproducts locally.

2. Next, read the *'Introduction'* section of the [**CCLUB User Manual**](https://greet.anl.gov/publication-cclub-manual-r6-2020). This section provides background on the purpose of the CCLUB model and explain how CCLUB uses **Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)** outputs with emission factors (EF) to estimate GHG emissions of LUC.

## Step 2: Choose & Configure Your Scenario (LUC)

Follow the inputs **top ‚Üí bottom** on the **LUC Scenario & Results** sheet, then review the results at the end. Users select input values in the **rose-colored** cells. All options are visible in the **yellow** cells in each section.

### 2.1 Select Feedstock to Fuel Pathway ‚Äî *Input 1*
The first user input (Input 1) is the feedstock-to-fuel pathway. The user can choose from among the biofuel production scenarios, which include options for corn and cellulosic ethanol feedstock (corn stover, switchgrass, or Miscanthus), and soy biodiesel. Each scenario reflects a shock to the economy in response to an increase in demand for a particular biofuel modeling by **GTAP**. In this case study, we will focus on the following ethanol production scenarios:
| # | Ethanol Pathway       | GTAP Case Description                                                                 |
|---|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Corn Ethanol 2011      | Increase in corn ethanol production from its 2004 level (3.41 BG) to 15 BG      |
| 2 | Stover Ethanol         | Increase of ethanol from corn stover by 9 BG, on top of 15 BG corn ethanol (continuous corn) |
| 3 | Switchgrass Ethanol    | Increase of ethanol from switchgrass by 7 BG, on top of 15 BG corn ethanol      |
| 4 | Miscanthus Ethanol     | Increase of ethanol from miscanthus by 7 BG, on top of 15 BG corn ethanol       |

**Note**: For more details on GTAP modeling, see *Section 2* of the **CCLUB User Manual**.

### 2.2 Select an SOC & N‚ÇÇO Modeling Scenario ‚Äî *Input 2*
User input 2 allows the user to specify how soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrous oxide (N‚ÇÇO) emissions are modeled for both domestic and international LUC. These options determine which datasets and emission factors are applied in the calculations.

Here‚Äôs what each option means:
| Option | Name             | Domestic SOC & N‚ÇÇO Source | International SOC & N‚ÇÇO Source | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1      | DayCent & Winrock          | **DayCent** (process-based SOC at daily timestep) + **COLE** for forest aboveground carbon | **Winrock dataset** country-/administrative-level EFs for forest, grassland, and cropland pasture conversions. Key assumptions: (1) Includes CH‚ÇÑ and N‚ÇÇO emissions from biomass burning during land clearing; (2) No carbon storage in harvested wood products (HWP); and (3) Includes foregone sequestration | Provides empirically derived, country-level LUC emission factors and serves as the EPA default conservative baseline, often resulting in higher emissions (e.g., due to exclude HWP carbon storage.) |
| 2      | DayCent & AEZ-EF           | **DayCent** + **COLE**    | **AEZ-EF** (Agro-Ecological Zone emission factors) | Hybrid approach combining U.S. process-based SOC modeling with AEZ-level international carbon/N‚ÇÇO factors:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. |
| 3      | AEZ-EF                     | **AEZ-EF** (applied domestically with COLE for forest) | **AEZ-EF** | Simplified and consistent option; uses spatially explicit AEZ-level emission factors for both domestic and international LUC. |
| 4      | Century & Winrock          | **CENTURY** (parameterized SOC model, inverse modeling) + **COLE** | **Winrock dataset** | Uses CENTURY-based SOC estimates at county/AEZ level; combined with Winrock‚Äôs empirical international dataset:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. |
| 5      | Other methods (Sec. 3‚Äì5)   | Alternatives: CENTURY/COLE, Woods Hole | Alternatives: Winrock or Woods Hole, IPCC factors | Allows use of alternative datasets (e.g., Woods Hole biome-level EFs, IPCC defaults) for advanced or comparative analysis:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. |


| **Name**       | **Domestic SOC & N‚ÇÇO Source** | **International SOC & N‚ÇÇO Source** | **Main Assumptions** | **Characteristics** |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **DayCent**    | ‚úîÔ∏è Process-based SOC at daily timestep; paired with COLE for forest aboveground carbon | ‚Äì | Daily time-step SOC modeling; calibrated for U.S. conditions | High-resolution, process-based SOC modeling for the U.S.; captures daily dynamics of soil carbon and N‚ÇÇO. |
| **CENTURY**    | ‚úîÔ∏è Parameterized SOC model (inverse modeling) at county/AEZ level; paired with COLE | ‚Äì | Inverse modeling approach; county/AEZ averages | Provides county- or AEZ-level SOC estimates; less dynamic than DayCent but widely applied in U.S. LCA studies. |
| **AEZ-EF**     | ‚úîÔ∏è Can be applied domestically (with COLE for forest carbon) | ‚úîÔ∏è AEZ-level global EFs for forest, grassland, cropland | Biome-/AEZ-level averages; includes peatland-specific factors (e.g., palm expansion in SE Asia) | Spatially explicit, zone-level factors; consistent across domestic and international use; used by CARB for LCFS. |
| **Winrock**    | ‚Äì (optional for U.S. if selected instead of process models) | ‚úîÔ∏è Country-/administrative-level EFs for forest, grassland, cropland pasture conversions | (1) Includes CH‚ÇÑ & N‚ÇÇO from burning; (2) No HWP carbon storage; (3) Includes foregone sequestration | Empirically derived, globally consistent; often yields higher emissions due to conservative assumptions; aligned with EPA RFS analysis. |
| **Woods Hole** | ‚úîÔ∏è Alternative U.S. biome-level EFs (forest/grassland conversion) | ‚úîÔ∏è Alternative biome-level global EFs | Biome-level averages; includes partial HWP storage assumptions | Biome-scale (e.g., temperate evergreen forest); simpler than Winrock; often used for sensitivity or comparison. |
| **Other / IPCC defaults** | Optional | Optional | IPCC Tier 1 or other published defaults | Provides flexibility for sensitivity or comparative analysis. |



### 2.3 Set International Dataset ‚Äî *Input 3*
- **3a ‚Äî International dataset**: choose **Winrock** (country/state-level) or **Woods Hole/AEZ-EF** (biome/AEZ-level) for **non-U.S.** carbon, CH‚ÇÑ, and N‚ÇÇO emission factors (EFs).
- **3b ‚Äî Palm expansion on peat (Winrock only)**: percent of palm expansion on peat in SE Asia (commonly **0%** or **22%**).

> **Tip (Canada-focused analysis):** Canada is **international** in CCLUB. Select **Winrock** to use **country-level** EFs for Canada.

### 2.4 Configure Forest Products Assumption (U.S.) ‚Äî *Input 4*
Choose **HWP (Harvested Wood Products)** handling for U.S. forests when converted:
- **Heath et al. (1996)** assumptions, or
- **All aboveground C emitted** (no product credit).

### 2.5 Biomass Burning in International Clearing ‚Äî *Input 5*
- With **Winrock**: ‚ÄúYes‚Äù applies burning only in countries where it is common (per Winrock); ‚ÄúNo‚Äù disables it.
- With **CENTURY/Woods Hole**: ‚ÄúYes‚Äù applies burning in all international countries; ‚ÄúNo‚Äù disables it.

### 2.6 U.S. Forest Adjustment (Proration) ‚Äî *Input 6*
Toggle **Yes** to apply CCLUB‚Äôs adjustment that splits GTAP ‚Äúforest‚Äù conversions into **mature forest** vs **young-forest/shrub** (to better match U.S. inventories); **No** keeps raw GTAP.

### 2.7 Spatial Averaging Method ‚Äî *Input 7*
Choose how EFs are aggregated spatially (e.g., **area-weighted**). Applies to both domestic and international EF aggregation.

### 2.8 Foregone Sequestration Period ‚Äî *Input 8*
Use **30 years** to align with underlying EF time horizons (consistent with CENTURY/Winrock modeling). Large deviations can lead to inconsistent results.

### 2.9 Amortization Period ‚Äî *Input 9*
Set the policy analysis horizon (e.g., **30 years**) over which total LUC emissions are annualized.
