# üöó GREET Model Tutorial

The GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies) model, developed by Argonne National Laboratory in the United States, is a tool that enables users to evaluate the full life cycle environmental impacts of fuels and vehicle technologies. It allows for detailed calculation of greenhouse gas emissions, criteria air pollutants, and energy use from feedstock production through vehicle operation. This tutorial is designed to guide students through the basics of conducting a fuel life cycle assessment using GREET
