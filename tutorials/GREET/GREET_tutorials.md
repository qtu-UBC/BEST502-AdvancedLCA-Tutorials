# üöó GREET Model Tutorial

The GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies) model, developed by Argonne National Laboratory in the United States, is a tool that enables users to evaluate the full life cycle environmental impacts of fuels and vehicle technologies. It allows for detailed calculation of greenhouse gas emissions, criteria air pollutants, and energy use from feedstock production through vehicle operation. This tutorial is designed to guide students through the basics of conducting a fuel life cycle assessment using GREET

## üìù Case Study:
The GREET model provides two options: GREET .NET, which offers a graphical and user-friendly interface for exploring and analyzing complex energy and fuel pathways, and GREET Excel, a spreadsheet-based version that allows users to view and modify explicit formulas within the sheets. This tutorial will use **GREET Excel** for demonstration.

Download the **GREET tutorial - BEST 502** and follow the step-by -step instructions to complete the tutorial. 

If you‚Äôre interested in how the GREET model calculates energy consumption and GHG emissions, you can access the GREET YouTube tutorial shown above.
