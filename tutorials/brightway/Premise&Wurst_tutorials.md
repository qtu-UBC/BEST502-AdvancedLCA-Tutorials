# ðŸŒ± Wurst & Premise Tutorials  

These tutorials are adapted from the 2024 Brightway autumn school teaching repository:  
[https://github.com/romainsacchi/autumn-school-dds-psi-2024.git](https://github.com/romainsacchi/autumn-school-dds-psi-2024.git)

They cover **prospective Life Cycle Assessment (pLCA)** methods, focusing on modifying ecoinvent databases with **Integrated Assessment Model (IAM)** scenarios (Premise) and exploring database transformation workflows (Wurst).
