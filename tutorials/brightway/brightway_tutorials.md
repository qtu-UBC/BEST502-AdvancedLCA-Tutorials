# üìö Brightway Tutorials

These tutorials are adapted from the official Brightway teaching repository:  
[https://github.com/brightway-lca/from-the-ground-up](https://github.com/brightway-lca/from-the-ground-up)

They cover step-by-step use of Brightway for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), including supply chain graph analysis, data import, matrix building, and interpretation.
